    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
    <h2>Bear wiki</h2>

    The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America. In North America, the
    populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears, while the subspecies that inhabits the Kodiak Islands of Alaska
    is known as the Kodiak bear. It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in
    size only by its closest relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and
    slightly bigger on average. <br><br>
